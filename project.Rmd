```{r}

wbfp <- read.csv("Body Fat data.csv")

plot(x=wbfp$Waist_Size, y=wbfp$Percent_Body_Fat, pch = 16, cex = 1.3, col = "blue", main="Waist vs Body Fat", xlab = "Waist Size (in)", ylab="Body Fat Percentage")



```
``` {r}

linearMod <- lm(Waist_Size ~ Percent_Body_Fat, data=wbfp)
abline(linearMod)

```
```{r}

summary(linearMod) 

```
p value is 0.007574, which is < 0.05, so we can say that the model is statistically significant and we reject the null hypothesis.
